# LSTM-using-pyTorch

I implemented a challenging LSTM network using pyTorch on the MNIST dataset.

## Sequence prediction problems have been around for a long time. They are considered as one of the hardest problems to solve in the data science industry. These include a wide range of problems; from predicting sales to finding patterns in stock markets’ data, from understanding movie plots to recognizing your way of speech, from language translations to predicting your next word on your iPhone’s keyboard.

With the recent breakthroughs that have been happening in data science, it is found that for almost all of these sequence prediction problems, Long short Term Memory networks, a.k.a LSTMs have been observed as the most effective solution.

LSTMs have an edge over conventional feed-forward neural networks and RNN in many ways. This is because of their property of selectively remembering patterns for long durations of time. 

Results are wonderful :
